    "#### Task 1\n",
    "[Geo-Python](https://geo-python.github.io/2018/), is interesting since it focuses on how Python can be used in geo-fields like geophysics, geology and geography. Also goes over the use of packages that seem critical for these respective fields such as NumPy, Pandas, and MapPlotLib (which I mention later in Task 2). It even goes over debugging and errors which I think is very important for coding since it may save time on researching what is causing issues in one's code.   \n",

    "A) [SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/), works with SQL databases which provides a full load of capabilities and \n",
    "   access to the databases including relational mapping.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), a scientific computing library that reads arbitary values, serves a multi-dimensional array \n",
    "   object for the data analysis and manipulation. Contains tools that work with C/C++ and Fortran code, also have Fourier \n",
    "   transform and random number capabilities. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/), is an event-driven networking library that makes adding networking applications \n",
    "   into python code easy. Supporting network protocols include: SMTP, POP3, IMAP, SSHv2, and DNS.\n",
    "   \n",
    "B) [MapPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), is a library that plots in 2D with only a few lines of code. You can create \n",
    "   interactive navigationt tools with it as well. The library even has toolkits that can used to accomplish more specific goals\n",
    "   including 3D plotting! \n",
    "   \n",
    "   [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/), is another library that works like ggplot but is geared\n",
    "   more towards web browsers and strives to make the data visualization both functionally and aesthetically pleasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a library that works with dataframes utilizes a wide variety of Python libraries to \n",
    "   accomplish specific tasks in statistical analysis, visualization, domain specifics, and API use.   \n"
