The OD aggregation is done.  All of the different tract level relationships should be 
unique.  At least from the testing I've done it should be.

RAC and WAC aggregation both will take the same code, but I still need to test if it works.
The data aggregation for this right now is pretty inefficient so I'm going to keep on working
on it until it's a bit more efficient.  That or I find out how to export the data into a
CSV so you can just read that file if I can make it.

Comment out the RAC stuff first and uncomment the OD stuff.
